📖 Project Overview
This project uses real estate data to build a predictive model that estimates house prices in Bangalore. It involves steps like cleaning data, applying regression algorithms, tuning the model, and deploying it with a user-friendly web interface.

🧠 Key Concepts
Supervised Learning: Using regression models for price prediction.
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handling null values, outliers, and categorical variables.
Feature Engineering: Extracting meaningful insights from existing data to improve prediction.
Model Performance Metrics: Evaluating the model using R² Score, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), etc.
Web Deployment: Integrating the model into a Flask application for end-user interaction.

🌱 Recommended Practices
Normalize or scale your data when needed.
Always check for multicollinearity.
Keep your model interpretable for real-world use.
Clean, well-labeled UI improves user experience.


❓ Common Questions
Q: Can this be used outside Bangalore?
A: This model is trained only on Bangalore housing data. For other cities, retraining is required.

Q: Which algorithm performs best?
A: Multiple regression models were tested; results vary based on data preprocessing and feature selection.

🛠 Debugging Tips
If the UI doesn’t load, confirm Flask is running.
Make sure all required packages from requirements.txt are installed.
Check terminal logs for missing files or model paths.
