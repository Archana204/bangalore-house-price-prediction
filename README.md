📖 Project Overview
This project uses real estate data to build a predictive model that estimates house prices in Bangalore. It involves steps like cleaning data, applying regression algorithms, tuning the model, and deploying it with a user-friendly web interface.

🧠 Key Concepts
Supervised Learning: Using regression models for price prediction.
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handling null values, outliers, and categorical variables.
Feature Engineering: Extracting meaningful insights from existing data to improve prediction.
Model Performance Metrics: Evaluating the model using R² Score, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), etc.
Web Deployment: Integrating the model into a Flask application for end-user interaction.
